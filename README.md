# Makeup-Products-Recommender-System
GoalsÂ¶
To build several recommender systems for current users and potential users with different approaches:

Demographic filtering: based purely on overall ratings of products

Collaborative filtering: based on user-item interaction history

Content based filtering: based on product features and user features -- in progress

Hybrid model: based on user feature, item feature, and interaction, potentially recommending products to new users according to user input -- in progress
