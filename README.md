# Makeup-Products-Recommender-System
### GoalsÂ¶
To build several recommender systems for current users and potential users with different approaches:

> __Demographic filtering:__ based purely on overall ratings of products

> __Collaborative filtering:__ based on user-item interaction history

> __Content based filtering:__ based on product features and user features -- in progress

> __Hybrid model:__ based on user feature, item feature, and interaction, potentially recommending products to new users according to user input -- in progress
